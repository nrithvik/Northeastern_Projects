Approach:

-> The program runs by obtaining the Username and password from the user

-> The IP address of the server is resolved from the hostname by the 
   gethostbyname() function.

-> A GET message is sent to the server with host and other details

-> Server responds with 200-OK message with “csrftoken” and “Session-ID”

-> Client gets the “csrftoken”,”Session-ID” from the GET message and “Username” and “Password” from the command line and sends these information in a POST message.

-> Server responds with 302-FOUND message along with the URL to which further requests are to be sent. 

-> Client sends a GET message to the new location with “csrftoken” and “Session-ID”.

-> Server responds with 200-OK and sends the requested page. The retrieved page is parsed to find links and they are stored in a list(“mainlist”). The no of links found in a page are stored in a separate list(Sublist_legth)

-> A sublist is created which accepts part of the mainlist(equal to the number of links denoted by each value of Sublist_length). It is traversed to find further links in the subsequent pages and they are stored in the “mainlist”.

->Each entry in the mainlist is allowed only after checking if the entry starts with ‘/fakebook/’ and if it is not already present in the list.

-> Each page is parsed to check if there is any flag present. If yes, the flag is retrieved and stored in a separate list named “secret_flags”.
-> Each response from the server is checked and errors are handled as below

If the response is “301 MOVED PERMANENTLY”, the new location is retrieved and the request is redirected.   
If the response is “403 FORBIDDEN”, an error is thrown to the user and connection is terminated.
If the response is “404 NOT FOUND”, an error is thrown to the user and connection is terminated.
If the response is “500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR”, socket is re-established and the request is sent again.
 
Challenges Faced:

-> Had issues understanding the flow of messages between the client and the server.  ran the browser version of “Fakebook” and analyzed the conversation through Wireshark. 

-> Initially not sure about the parameters to be declared inside GET and POST messages.

-> The response from the server was split between different packets, so kept listening to the response until the entire message body was received. 

-> The program ended abruptly without any indication.  opened and closed the socket for each request by the client and response from the server.

-> Unable to traverse the “mainlist” while appending values to it.  created a “sublist” which takes in part of the “mainlist” and traverses through the links.

-> The Session-ID of the OK message and FOUND message were different.  had to catch the Session ID each time and ensure that the next request has the last received Session ID.


Testing the code:

Entered the Username and password in the command-line and checked for Secret-flags inside all links that are being traversed. 

-> Checked and verified if the credentials entered are authentic.

-> Checked for any unexpected responses from the Server and caught those exceptions. 

-> Checked if the flag received contains a 64 byte flag. 

-> Checked and ensured that the socket is not being kept open for long time.
